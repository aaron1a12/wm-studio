# Studio

A workplace productivity tracker and project management solution.

I wrote this tool in 2015 to improve our workflow and organize our VFX jobs during the production of [The Illustrator](https://www.amazon.com/Illustrator-Yadira-Escobar/dp/B08DCN5L8R/).

It also included a built-in productivity tracker so team members could look at their own scores and remain competitive with each other. During peak production, this tool improved overall productivity among us significantly.
